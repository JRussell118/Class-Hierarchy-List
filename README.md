# Class-Hierarchy-List
### This program creates a GUI for the user to choose a file of classes, then creates a graph, hierarchy list, and parenthesized list of the graph's contents.
The program reads the Class List.txt file and displays the hierarchy list of the written classes and uses a depth first search to find unreachable classes. Each line in the text file reads a class and it's children into the program.
